# csv-to-xlsx
### Convert csv data to xlsx 

Two Jupyter Notebooks highlight the process using 
 - openpyxl - [using_openpyxl_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkCruse/csv-to-xlsx/blob/master/using_openpyxl_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb)
 - xlsxwriter - [using_xlsxwriter_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkCruse/csv-to-xlsx/blob/master/using_xlsxwriter_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb)
 
Both will accomplish the same task. Some claim OpenPyXL is more robust because it allows individual worksheet cells to be manipulated and worksheet styling.  However, the documentation looks pretty robust for XlsxWriter.
