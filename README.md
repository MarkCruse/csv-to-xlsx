# csv-to-xlsx
### Convert csv data to xlsx 

Two Jupyter Notebooks highlight the process using 
 - openpyxl - [using_openpyxl_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkCruse/csv-to-xlsx/blob/master/using_openpyxl_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb)
 - xlsxwriter - [using_xlsxwriter_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkCruse/csv-to-xlsx/blob/master/using_xlsxwriter_csv_to_xlsx.ipynb)
 
Both will accomplish the same task. However, initial experimentation shows the openpyxl is more robust and allows for the manipulation of cells in the workbook.
 
 More to come...
